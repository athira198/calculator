forEach() calls a function for each element in an array:
addEventListener() -Add an event listener that fires when a user clicks a button
The Element property innerHTML gets or sets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element
eg:document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
set p tag to hello world

Get the element that triggered a specific event:target

alert(event.target);

The dot notation is used to access the object properties in JavaScript.

value-The value property sets or returns the value of the value attribute of a text field.
Set the value property:

textObject.value = text
Data
The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.  eg:data-num
The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"
An HTML data-* attribute and its corresponding DOM dataset.property modify their shared name according to where they are read or written
In JavaScript
The property name of a custom data attribute is the same as the HTML attribute without the data- prefix, and removes single dashes (-) for when to capitalize the property's "camelCased" name.
eg: el.dataset.user === 'carinaanand'
function(e)=it will work only when an event is happen
